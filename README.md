# AEM 6510 - Environmental and Resource Economics

**Class location:** Warren 138

**Class time:** Tues/Thurs 2:55-4:10

**Office hours:** Wed 3:00-4:30 Warren 462.

**Textbook:** A Course in Environmental Economics by Phaneuf and Requate is required. [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://www.scunning.com/mixtape.html) by Cunningham is also required and free. 

**Prerequisites:** MATH 1110 or equivalent. 

**Course description:** An introduction to environmental economics. The first half of the class focuses on the core theory, theory of regulation, and theory of welfare analysis. The second half of the course covers empirical topics. We will be learning how to use R for empirical research in environmental economics.

**Course requirements:** Students are expected to attend two 75 minute lectures per week for the entire semester. In addition, students are expected to prepare for class, prelims, and complete homework outside of class. 

## Grading and Assignments

### Grading
- Prelims: 30% and 20%
- Problem sets: 25%
- Literature review paper: 20%
- Literature review presentation: 5%

The grading scale is:
- A: 92-100; A-: 90-91
- B+: 88-89; B: 82-87; B-: 80-81
- C+: 78-79; C: 72-77; C-: 70-71
- D+: 68-69; D: 62-67; D-: 60-61
- F: < 60

### Prelims

There will be 2 prelims. Your higher-scoring prelim will be 30% of your grade, your lower-scoring prelim will be 20% of your grade. If you miss a prelim without an acceptable excuse you will receive a zero.  If you have an acceptable excuse (these must be brought in beforehand except for sickness, injuries, accidents, etc) an alternative prelim will be scheduled. If you miss a prelim and do not notify me beforehand you must have a valid document (doctor's note, etc) explaining why you missed class and were not able to let me know before the missed prelim. 

### Problem sets

You will have problem sets due about every 4 weeks. You may work in groups of up to 3 on problem sets. Problem sets may be turned in late with a penalty of 20% of that homework's grade for each day it is late. Problem sets are due at the start of class on Canvas.

### Literature review

You will have to do a literature review on an environmental, resource, or energy economics topic of your choice. In the last week of class you will give a short presentation of your review of the literature. Papers are due the last day of class. Please talk to me about potential topics. More details will be distributed in a few weeks.

### Readings

Some sections of the course have readings (available on Canvas if not in the book). The lectures, homeworks and exams will draw from these readings. Lecture notes will be posted online at the end of each section.

## Other topics

## Important dates

- Prelim 1
- Take home prelim
- Literature review presentations

**Attendance:** Class attendance is not explicitly required but highly recommended.

**Grade appeals:** If you wish to appeal your grade on an exam, quiz or homework you must bring it to my attention, in writing, within 24 hours of when the prelim or problem set is returned.  Grades brought to my attention after this will not be eligible for a grade appeal. I reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment and the new grade will be final.

**Group work:** For problem sets, you may consult with me during office hours or with other students. Problem sets can done in groups of up to 3. If you work in a group, turn in only one assignment for the group. You must complete prelims without help.

**Integrity of credit:** I expect every student in this course to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity. I strongly encourage collaboration in this course, but each student is responsible for making sure that she or he follows the rules laid out in this syllabus, and with those stated in the Code of Academic Integrity. Any student found to have violated the stated policies on problem sets will receive a zero for that assignment, and any student found to have cheated on a prelim will receive a zero on that prelim. Multiple violations in a semester may result in failure of the course. The Code of Academic Integrity is available for review here: https://cuinfo.cornell.edu/aic.cfm.
